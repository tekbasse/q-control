introduction
------------

Q-Control provides a role-based access control system.

With Q-Control, users are assigned roles, roles are 
assigned privileges, and properties are assigned to an 
independent group_id. 

Apps that depend on this package create tests similar 
to OpenACS permissions system to determine if user has 
read, create, write, delete, or admin rights per property 
(or property class) tested.

features
--------

Works in context of subsite, individual package, or a set of packages.

Is layered on top of OpenACS permissions.

Users must have OpenACS read privilege to invoke additional Q-Control approvals.

Users with OpenACS Package Admin privilege have all approvals in context.

Low learning-curve compared to customizing OpenACS' group permissions 
of party/person/group and how permissions change based on 
the types of relations between groups and the types of memberships of user 
relations in groups as described at: 
 http://openacs.org/doc/permissions-tediously-explained.html
